# 5.1 FIRST MMO SIMULATION

## WHAT IS IT?

The main goal of the simulation is to approximate the behaviour of a large number of players playing in groups in the same MMO, when different LSs are adopted.

## GETTING STARTED

In order to use the software you will download the NetLogo enviroment from https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/ and open the "FirstMMOSimulation.nlogo" file with the NetLogo IDE.
The software was tested under a Window 10 machine; anyway, it should also work on different OS. 

## HOW IT WORKS AND HOW TO USE IT

The parameters of the simaulation are already setted with the survey parameter.
Anyway, almost all parameter can be modified in the interface tab.

Thus, the enviroment can be consider plug and play. To use it with the default paramenter, the user should click on setup button -> set-setup button and, after that, the go button.
The setup button should be pressed if and only if you want to create a new and empty csv file. 

In the interface tab, the user can modify these parameters:

TODO

Lastly, the output area on the right visualize the increment of power of the different category of players.

## THINGS TO NOTICE

The software was developed and tested using NetLogo 6.0.1

## CREDITS AND REFERENCES

This simulation and the simulation outcome will be presented in the special issue on "Agent-based Modelling and Simulation" of the journal "Special Issue on Agent-based Modelling and Simulation".

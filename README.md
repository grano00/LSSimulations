# Introduction

This repository contains the source code of the simulations developed in order to understand the players' behavior under different types of Looting Systems (LS).

## Getting Started

The simulations were developed in NetLogo (https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/).

### NetLogo Installation

NetLogo is a multiplatform software. It works under Linux, Mac, and Window OS.
The NetLogo binary files are available on the web page of the product.
The enviroment source code is available on Github at the url https://github.com/NetLogo/NetLogo
For a detailed explanation of installation and operation, please refer to the NetLogo user manual http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/faq.html

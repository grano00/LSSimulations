# Introduction

This repository contains the source code of the simulations developed in order to understand the players' behavior under different types of Looting Systems (LS).

## Getting Started

The simulations were developed in NetLogo (https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/).

### NetLogo Installation

NetLogo is a multiplatform software. It works under Linux, Mac, and Window OS.
The NetLogo binary files are available on the web page of the product.
The enviroment source code is available on Github at the url https://github.com/NetLogo/NetLogo
For a detailed explanation of installation and operation, please refer to the NetLogo user manual http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/faq.html

# 5.1_In_the_shoes_of_the_player

The main goal of the simulation is to approximate the behaviour of a large number of players playing in groups in the same MMO, when different LSs are adopted.

# 5.2_What_a_game_designer_dreams_of

It consider the whole MMO world from the point of view of the game designer, the information that can be derived from the previous simulation is clearly insufficient. 
As a matter of fact, the goals of the company managing the game are to maximize both the number of (paying) players and their satisfaction; hence, the vision of a single individual is not enough.
Players belonging to a specific category share common behavioural traits; hence, their relative number may influence heavily the general climate of a specific world, and – possibly – its success or failure.
In this framework, our goal is to verify if the choice of a specific LS can influence – and to what extent – the balance among player types.

# 6_Players_getting_competitive_MOBA_LS

Starting from League of Legends (LoL) data collected, through some interviewed to Italian and Finland players, we have set up a simulation aimed at measuring how much their satisfaction with the game is influenced by the LS. 
This game is probably the most diffused and representative MOBA (another massive game genre).
Interestingly, LoL has also been a pioneer in introducing a LS. 
The simulation analyze the satisfaction of LoL players regarding the Hextech Crafting.
